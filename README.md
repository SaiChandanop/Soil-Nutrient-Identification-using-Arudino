# Soil-Nutrient-Identification-using-Arudino
We have provided a very effective solution to develop an intelligent system for Farmers whose core is Arduino.  
In this framework we illustrate a programmed electrochemical sensor framework for nonstop supplement assurance. The flow-through electrochemical sensor framework with two terminal framework works based on stream infusion investigation (FIA) method for recognizing the supplements. The essential point of this framework to create a touchy and solid electrochemical sensor framework for observing the supplements in soil test for long-term applications.  
In India, where the economy is basically base on farming and the climatic conditions. The primary reason is the need of downpours and scarifies of arrive store water and abused of fertilizers so we require to control these parameters. This framework made remote sensor organize for checking rural situations for different components such as NPK, temperature and stickiness along with other variables can be of centrality. By which we can apply fertilizer to the put where it needs, too we can maintain a strategic distance from over fertilization of the crops. A key in soil testing for defined fertilization is to decide the amount of soil supplements, taken after by proposal of supplement needs and site-specific fertilization. This consider planning
